# rohitcy.github.io

Repository for blog built with Jekyll and hosted with github pages.

The **master** branch contains the built website. It is generated automatically using the `deploy` script in the **development** branch.

Since Github Pages does not allow the jekyll-whiteglass theme.

NOTE: `master` only contains deployment commits and built site please head over to `development` branch which contains the actual code.
